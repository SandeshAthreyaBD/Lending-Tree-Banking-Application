LendingTree works by connecting a customer with one or more of the trusted lenders in its network. 
These loans come from top quality lenders, not from payday loan providers. 
You can receive more than one offer from different lenders, and can then choose among them. 
Just because you have received offers does not obligate you to take one. Once you accept a loan, how you use proceed is entirely up to you.
The Lending Tree is a java application developed using the IDE - Net Beans, utilizing JDBC to run the data access layer and fetch/store the data from or to the database and swings for the presentation layer.
The Lending Tree application has 3 main modules that put the entire application as a whole. There are three main users or roles.

ADMINISTRATOR
This is the first role. Administrator is the one with the highest authority. Once logged in as an “Admin” he will be able to add customers, lenders and other admins himself.
There are certain preferences that the application offers only to the administrator. The “Editing”, “Adding” and “Updating” features for the fields entered by the customer and lender.

LENDER
This is the second role. The Bank has to first register as a “Lender”. After logging in as a lender, he will be able to view the profile that he has entered. As a main functionality, the lender is now able to offer the type of loan that he intends to attract the customer and enter all the details into it.

CUSTOMER
This is the final role. The Customer has to first register himself into the system and then log in. After logging in, he will be able to view his own profile. Upload documents for the banks to view. View the loans offered by the banks. Make a neat filtered customized search. And also generate a Jasper report so that the user is able to make a clean choice between the best offers.

This project was done as a 3 weeks university project.
